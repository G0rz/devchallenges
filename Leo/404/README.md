Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- This demo was made as a basic development practice only with HTML and CSS.
- It is a simple practice that helps remember the importance of a simple and well-structured code.
- Thanks to this practice, I improved the structure of my code, ensuring clean and minimal code.
- As a tip, try to abstract the elements of a website before starting to make a mock up.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/wBunSb7FPrIepJZAg0sY) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## Acknowledgements

-Step 1: Choose the type of display to work with.
   With this we can rely on things that already exist in CSS and that facilitate the arrangement of our visual elements

-Step 2: Abstract the visual elements.

-Step 3: Choose the appropriate html elements to represent the visual element.

-Step 4: Implement hierarchies (parent elements and child elements) and box theory

-Step 5: Use the minimum number of CSS styles.
   Analyze each visual element and define which CSS style can be used more than once, this way you can create classes and reduce the CSS code.
   It also analyzes whether the styles of the parent elements can affect the child elements, sometimes going from the inside out helps reduce the code.

-Step 6: Analyze and create Media Queries.
   Take the time to clean up the code, removing repeated styles or performing one more abstraction step.
   
-Step 7: Publish the website and test it on different devices.

This is in order to find visual details or strange behaviors of CSS styles.
